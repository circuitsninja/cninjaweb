If you use Windows OS at home, in order to start designing circuits using Open Circuit Design (OCD) tools and Open PDKs, you have to install Windows Subsystem for 
Linux (WSL). You could also download and use VMware to run Linux on Windows. 

The Open PDK I will use is the SkyWater130 PDK. Most of the information here, I gathered from Tim's [SKY130 installation instructions](http://opencircuitdesign.com/open_pdks/install.html) at [Opencircuitdesign.com](http://opencircuitdesign.com). I am not an IC CAD or software expert and I had to spend some time to search for information to fill in the gaps for certain steps in the installation process. I will detail them here in this post.




# 1. Installing WSL
# 2. Installing Ubuntu
# 3. Installing Ngspice
# 4. Installing SKY130
